For this subject I will follow the lectures of [Brian Harvey of CS61 in Berkley](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter).
This uses the book known as SICP - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.
This is freely found [here](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).
The course and the book uses Schema (a Lisp dialect) as the programming language for the explanations and exercises.
To be able to have Schema in the computer, the easiest way is to use docker (if you already know docker, of course).
There is the stklos folder with further instructions.
